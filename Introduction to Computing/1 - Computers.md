# Computers

There are input devices and output devices.

- Input: Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone, Camera, Scanner, Touchscreen

- Output: Monitor, Printer, Speaker, Headphone, Touchscreen

There are also storage devices.

- Hard Drive, Flash Drive, CD, DVD, Blu-Ray

## Processing

Processing is done on the CPU (Central Processing Unit).

| Input                                          |

ALU is the part of the CPU that does the calculations.

CU is the part of the CPU that controls memory


## Transistor

The transistor is the smallest unit of memory and logic, it can detect whether a voltage is high or low, being high, 1 and low, 0.

## Software

Drivers are software that allows the computer to communicate with the hardware.

Apps are software that allows the user to interact with the computer.
