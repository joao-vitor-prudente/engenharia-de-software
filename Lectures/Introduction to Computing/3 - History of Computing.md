# Some Consepts

## Moore's Law

The law says that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. This is a very important law because it is the basis for the exponential growth of computing power. It is also the reason why we have such powerful computers today.

Moore's Law is thought to be over since we are getting close to the size limit of the transistor. So we are trying to find a replacer for the silicon transistor (graphene or quantum maybe).

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the details of a system in order to simplify the system, exposing just the necessary to make it useful

## Computer Science

Computer science studies two things: computability theory and computational complexity teory

### Computability Theory

Studies what can be computed and how to compute it

### Computational Complexity Theory

Studies how much time and space is needed to compute something and how to compute it in the least amount of time and space
