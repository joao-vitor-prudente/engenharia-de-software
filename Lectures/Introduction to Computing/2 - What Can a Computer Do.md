# What Can a Computer Do

A computer can do everything that can be serialized in a series of well defined steps.

The computer can only understend presence or absence of energy (0, 1).

With that we can encode operations with information, the information it self and the administrate the memory.

Since a sequence of 0 and 1 is uninteligible to humans, we created abstraction layers to make it more human readable (programming language).

An algorithm is a sequence of instructions and software is a set of algorithms.
