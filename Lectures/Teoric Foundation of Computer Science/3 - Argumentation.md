# Argumentation

A premise is a set of propositions with connectives

Argumentation is a set of premisses and a conclusion that is implicated by rhe premisses.

## Validity

An argument is valid if and only if it is impossible for the premisses to be true and the conclusion to be false.

Which means that the conclusion does not follow strictly from the premisses

Cares about structure

## Soundness

An argument is sound if and only if it is valid and the premisses are true.


## Deductive Argument

An argument is deductive if and only if it is valid.
